# Bear-ly Breaking Even

## Project Description:

Bear-ly Breaking Even is a budgeting app that helps users track their spendings and savings. Users will input their income as well as categories of expenses that they would like to keep track of, and will be able to input specific instances of spending into those categories, which will populate a database. Users will also be able to input recurring payments and paydays in order to better track budgets in real time. Using this data, the user will be able to see their spending patterns in each category of spending, so that they will be more mindful of their budgeting.
