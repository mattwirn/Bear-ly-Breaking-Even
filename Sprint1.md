## Issues Planned to Address

We wanted to address the first, sixth, and eighth user stories in this sprint. 

For the first user story, we implemented a sign up and log in functionality. The backend created a database to store usernames and passwords, set up the server connection, and created some POST functions for the API. The frontend team utilizied a boilerplate to set up the frontend of the application. From this they created interactive sign up and log in pages.

The sixth user story is still in progress - a color palette and logo were created and utilized in the front end.

Both the frontend and backend teams were unable to start implementing the eighth user story, as setting up everything for the front and back end and the first user story took longer than expected. In future sprints we plan to continue working on this.
