          Bear-ly Breaking Even is a budgeting app that helps users track their spendings
          and savings. Users will input their income as well as categories of expenses that
          they would like to keep track of, and will be able to input specific instances of 
          spending into those categories, which will populate a database. Using this data, 
          the user will be able to see their spending patterns in each category of spending, 
          so that they will be more mindful of their budgeting.</h1>
